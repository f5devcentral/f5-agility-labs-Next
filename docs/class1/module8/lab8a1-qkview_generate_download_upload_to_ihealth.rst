How to: Use BIG-IP Next Central Manager to generate and upload to iHealth a QKView file for BIG-IP Next instances
=================================================================================================================

Overview
========

You can generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next instance (either standalone or HA configuration), which is automatically uploaded to F5 iHealth.  Additionally, you can download the QKView file directly from BIG-IP Next Central Manager for a limited time after it is generated.

*Important*: The following procedures are intended for BIG-IP Next Central Manager. If you are running BIG-IP Next Central Manager, you will not be able to 
generate a QKView directly on your BIG-IP Next instance. If you manage your BIG-IP Next instances directly, use `How to: Generate & download a QKView file for BIG-IP Next and upload to F5 iHealth or Support <qkview_generate_download_upload_to_ihealth.html>`_ to generate and download a QKView file for manual upload to iHealth.


Prerequisites
=============

- BIG-IP Next instances are added to BIG-IP Next Central Manager.
- If generating a QKView task for BIG-IP Next HA instances, identify whether you are generating a QKView file for the active or standby node, or both. 
- `F5 iHealth <https://www.f5.com/services/support/support-offerings/big-ip-ihealth-diagnostic-tool>`_ account credentials.
- (Optional) A F5 Support case number.


Procedures
==========
You can generate and download a QKView file that is automatically uploaded to iHealth for a BIG-IP Next standalone or HA instance using the BIG-IP Next Central Manager's UI or API:

* :ref:`Generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next instance`
* :ref:`Download a QKView file`
* :ref:`Delete a QKView file log entry`

**Generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next instance**
-----------------------------------------------------
When generating a QKView file from BIG-IP Next Central Manager, the generated file is automatically
uploaded to your iHealth account. 

If you have not yet created a iHealth account, you need to create one before you proceed. Go to `F5 iHealth <https://www.f5.com/services/support/support-offerings/big-ip-ihealth-diagnostic-tool>`_ to create an account.

Once the QKView file generation process is complete, review the status to ensure the QKView file was successfully uploaded to iHealth:

* **Completed** - The QKView file was generated and automatically sent to the iHealth account.
* **Failed** - The QKView file either failed to generate, or was generated, but was not sent to the iHealth account. If this occurs you can :ref:`Download a QKView file` to manually upload to iHealth. You will not be able to download a QKView file that failed to generate. You can retry `generating a QKView file :ref:`Generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next HA instance`.  

Use one of the following procedures based on your BIG-IP Next instance configuration, and whether you are using the UI or API:

* :ref:`Generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next HA instance`
* :ref:`Generate a QKView file for a standalone BIG-IP Next instance - UI`
* :ref:`Generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next instance - API`

Send a post request to generate a QKView file for a BIG-IP Next instance. The generated QKView file is
automatically uploaded to the iHealth account listed in the request. Ensure that you have the following information available:

* `instance_id` - To view a full list  of managed instances, send the following get request: 

.. code-block::console

   ``GET https://{{bigip_next_cm_mgmt_ip}}/api/device/inventory``

* `filename` - Add a unique file name to identify the QKView file.
* `ihealth_user` and `ihealth_password` - Have your iHealth account credentials ready. To check if your credentials are valid use the OpenAPI for QKView: `F5 BIG-IP Next API Specification - QKView Feature <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/big-iq/mgmt-api/v0.0.1/ApiReferences/bigip_public_api_ref/r_openapi-next.html#tag/QkviewFeature>`_.
* `f5_support_case` - (Optional) you can add an F5 support case number to iHealth and share with the listed case owner.

 * The QKView task status is **Completed** - 1 day
 * The QKView task status is **Failed**- 7 days
 * QKView file task record information from the instance log - #. days

Once a QKView file is uploaded to iHealth, you can download directly from your iHealth account.
