How to: Create WAF Applications Using an Application Template on BIG-IP Next Central Manager
============================================================================================

Summary
=======
Use these procedures to create an HTTP or HTTPS application with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) security policy. 

To create an application with WAF protection, you need to use an application template. BIG-IP Next Central Manager provides three HTTP FAST application templates for HTTP and one template for HTTPS. If required, you can create a new application template that includes a WAF policy. 

After you create the application, you deploy the declaration and the policy to a BIG-IP Next instance. Any changes
made to the WAF policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager can be re-deployed to all associated instances.  

*Note*: For more information about using BIG-IP Next Central Manager for creating applications using a template, see `How to: Manage applications using Templates (UI) <cm_create_delete_apps.html>`_.


Prerequisites
=============

* Before you can create an application, you need to decide which template youâ€™re going to use. 

  - If you plan to use a custom application template, you must create a template before creating the application. See :ref:`Add WAF protection to a custom application template` for creating a new WAF-protected HTTP application template.
* If you plan to use an existing or cloned WAF policy, you must configure the policy in advance. To create or import a policy, see `How To: Configure WAF Policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager <cm_awaf_how_to_create_policy.html>`_
* One or more BIG-IP Next instances are discovered on BIG-IP Next Central Manager. Ensure you have the IP address of the BIG-IP Next instance you plan to deploy the application to.
* Required application and network parameter details, for example: server names or addresses, pool names, and pool member addresses or names.

WAF Application Templates
-------------------------
BIG-IP Next Central Manager provides three templates for creating a WAF-protected HTTP application.  
If the templates provided do not suit the needs of your application, you can create a new application template with WAF protection.

| **http-with-waf-existing-policy** - Use this template to create an HTTP application that includes a WAF policy that is already configured on BIG-IP Next Central Manager.
| **http-with-waf-cloned-policy** - Use this template to create an HTTP application with a WAF policy that is cloned from an existing policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager. This option allows you to make changes to the WAF policy without impacting other deployed applications with the same WAF policy.
| **http-with-waf-new-policy** - Use this template to create an HTTP application with a new WAF policy.
| **WAF-Secure-Load-Balancing-Service** - Use this template to create an HTTPS application with an existing, new, or cloned WAF policy. 

For more information about how to create and customize a WAF policy in BIG-IP Next Central Manager, see `How To: Configure WAF Policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager <cm_awaf_how_to_create_policy.html>`_

**Add WAF protection to a custom application template**
-------------------------------------------------------
Use this procedure to add a WAF policy to a customized application template. This procedure provides allows you to add a new, cloned, or existing WAF application to a custom FAST template.


#. Log in to BIG-IP Next Central Manager as admin, click the workspace switcher next to the F5 icon, and click **App Templates**.
#. Select a template to customize by clicking the name of the template. You can use any template, but the following already include definitions and parameters for a WAF policy:

   #. Template with existing WAF policy:**http-wth-waf-existing-policy**. For required definitions and parameters, see :ref:`Custom Template with Existing WAF Policy`.
   #. Template with option to clone a WAF policy: **http-with-waf-cloned-policy**. For required definitions and parameters, see `Custom Template with Cloned WAF Policy`.
   #. Template with option to create a new WAF policy **http-with-waf-new-policy**. For required definitions and parameters, see `Custom Template with New WAF Policy`.

      - BIG-IP Next Central Manager opens the template for editing.
#. Copy all of the content in the **Template Content** box.
#. Click **Cancel** to close the template editing screen.
#. At the top of the screen, click **Create**.

   The Create New Template page opens.
#. Type a **Name** and an optional **Description** in their respective fields.
#. In the **Template Content** text area, paste in the FAST template content that you copied to the clipboard.
#. Revise the FAST template code so that it describes the application you want to deploy based on the template you copied. Depending on the type of WAF policy (existing, cloned, new), ensure that the following definitions and parameters are included within your template.


.. _Custom Template with Existing WAF Policy:

**Custom Template with Existing WAF Policy**
--------------------------------------------
The following fields are required within application template definitions. See the following example:

WAFPolicyName:

 | type: string
 | title: WAF Policy Name
 | preProcessCM: wafPolicyList

Once you have added **WAFPolicyName** to the definitions, ensure the **preDeployCM** parameters are added. This ensures that the WAF policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager is deployed to the BIG-IP Next instance. See the following example that applies an HTTP application:


.. code-block:: json

 {
   "serviceMain": {
     "class": "Service_HTTP",
     "policyWAF": {
       "bigip": "preDeployCM:wafPolicy:{'policy_name'='{{WAFPolicyName}}'}"
     }
   }
 }


.. _Custom Template with Cloned WAF Policy:

**Custom Template with Cloned WAF Policy**
------------------------------------------
The following fields are recommended within application template definitions. See the following example:
*Note*: **ClonedWAFPolicyName** is not required, but recommended as it organizes the cloned policy within BIG-IP Next Central Manager's list of policies. 


WAFPolicyName:
 |   type: string
 |   title: WAF Policy Name
 |   preProcessCM: wafPolicyList
 |
ClonedWAFPolicyName: 
 |   type: string
 |   title: Cloned WAF Policy Name

After you have added **WAFPolicyName** to the definitions, ensure **preDeployCM** is specified. This ensures that the WAF policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager is deployed to the BIG-IP Next instance. See the following example that applies an HTTP application:


.. code-block:: json

 {
   "serviceMain": {
     "class": "Service_HTTP",
     "policyWAF": {
       "bigip": "preDeployCM:cloneWafPolicy:{'policy_name'='{{WAFPolicyName}}','cloned_policy_name'='{{ClonedWAFPolicyName}}'}"
     }
   }
 }


.. _Custom Template with New WAF Policy:

**Custom Template with New WAF Policy**
---------------------------------------
The following fields are recommended within application template definitions.  See the following example:

- Note for this version of BIG-IP Next Central Manager, the only WAF policy template available is Moderate-Protection. For **WAFPolicyTemplate**, the **default** field must be Moderate-Protection.



WAFPolicyName:
 |   type: string
 |   title: New WAF Policy Name
 |
WAFPolicyTemplate: 
 |   type: string
 |   title: WAF Policy Template
 |   default: Moderate-Protection

After you have added **WAFPolicyName** to the definitions, ensure **preDeployCM** is specified. This ensures that the WAF policy on BIG-IP Next Central Manager is deployed to the BIG-IP Next instance. See the following example that applies an HTTP application:


.. code-block:: json

 {
   "serviceMain": {
     "class": "Service_HTTP",
     "policyWAF": {
       "bigip": "preDeployCM:newWafPolicy:{'policy_name'='{{WAFPolicyName}}', 'template_name'='{{WAFPolicyTemplate}}'}"
     }
   }
 }
