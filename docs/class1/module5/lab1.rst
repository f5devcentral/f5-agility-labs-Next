* Show versioning of the template
* Deploy app again using the new template

Deploy an application with a WAF policy using FAST template
###########################################################
This part of the lab covers how to create and deploy an application and protect it with a WAF policy using the FAST template and the WAF violation rating based template with the focus on ease of use.

**Note:** The violation rating based template follows the same concept as you may know already from NGINX App Protect, which is low false positives with little policy maintenance and therefore the Policy Builder is not supported with the violation rating based template.

**12. Let's validate the application through the UDF Firefox**
    
 On the lab components, select "Access" under the "Ubuntu Jump Host" and select "Firefox."  Within this proxied Firefox, go to https://10.1.10.203 and you should see the Juice Shop app.

 .. image:: ./pictures/final_check.png

 |

 Enter https://10.1.10.203/a=<script> and you should see the blocking page.

 URL:

 .. code-block:: console
  
    https://10.1.10.203/a=<script>

 .. image:: ./pictures/block_check.png

|

**13. You can see your block requested by visiting the WAF dashbaord**

From Central Manager click on the top left menu to select the Security menu.

 .. image:: ./pictures/security-menu.png
  :scale: 50%

From the WAF Dashboard click on the down arrow and select your "waf-policy".

 .. image:: ./pictures/waf-dashboard-select-policy.png

You can now view your "good" and "bad" requests 

.. note:: The "Lab Progress" app will also make "bad" requests in the background

**14. (Optional)  WAF Event Logs**

.. note:: This next exercise is optional (if you are doing this as part of internal F5 training and are part of the "Security" track, please skip in favor of your dedicated "Security" lab)

The Firefox copy and paste function doesn't often work, so remember the first few digits of the blocking "Support ID" when you triggered a WAF block.

 .. image:: ./pictures/get-support-id.png
  
Next click "Event Logs" and enter the "Support ID" into the filter text box.

 .. image:: ./pictures/waf-events-search-support-id.png

You can then click on the URI to view more details
