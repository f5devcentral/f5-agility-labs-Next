Introduction to BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes

BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes manages traffic to and from multiple networks. Without BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes, multiple 
external firewalls are required for each network, without a way to manage those connections. BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes allows 
for a zero-trust architecture and a single point for **ingress and egress** to the Kubernetes clusters for firewall and DDoS security. 
It significantly simplifies security implementation which otherwise would need to take place at multiple locations throughout the network.

- Secure Ingress and Egress BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes enables security services applied at ingress and egress such as firewalling and DDoS.

- Hide Topology Topology hiding at ingress obscures the internal structure within the cluster.

- Visibility of Traffic As a central point of control, per-subscriber traffic visibility at ingress and egress allows traceability for compliance tracking and billing.
