Overview
========
Having completed some work with BIG-IP Next instance management, review the benefits of this approach as compared with the traditional BIG-IP paradigm

Benefits
=========

#. Central Management as standard management model, as compared with instance by instance management with optional bolt-on Central Management with BIG-IQ
#. Simplified addition of new instances via Central Manager 
#. Central Management can orchestrate upgrades of HA pairs (upgrade standby first, initiate failover, upgrade original active, automatic failback if desired); rollback if upgrade fails.

Summary
======
While the BIG-IP Next model is a significant change, there are tremendous benefits to the everyday operational tasks associated with managing a large collection of BIG-IP instances.
