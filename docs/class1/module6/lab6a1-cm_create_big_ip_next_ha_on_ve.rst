How to: Create a BIG-IP Next HA instance on VE from BIG-IP Next Central Manager
===============================================================================

Overview
========
A BIG-IP Next HA instance consists of an active and a standby node. Create a BIG-IP Next HA instance to safe-guard your applications and traffic in the event there is an issue with the provider the BIG-IP Next is installed on. In such an event, the active node in your BIG-IP Next HA instance will failover to the standby node with no disruption to current traffic or applications.

Prerequisites
=============
Before you can create a BIG-IP Next HA instance, you must have two standalone instances already onboarded to BIG-IP Next Central Manager. Refer to `How to: Onboard BIG-IP Next (GUI) <../configure_new_big_ip_ma_instance>`_ for details.

- Two standalone BIG-IP Next instances running the same software version in the same provider (VE) and in a healthy state.
- A license for the BIG-IP Next instance you want to designate as the active node.
- Between five and seven self IP addresses that are not assigned anywhere else in your network
- Traffic VLANS - One IP address for each BIG-IP Next instance, plus a floating IP address
- Control Plane HA VLAN - One IP address for each BIG-IP Next instance (by default, this VLAN will use two additional IP addresses on the management network, but you have the option to create a separate VLAN)
- Data Plane HA VLAN - One IP address for each BIG-IP Next instance

---------
Procedure
---------
#. Add a second BIG-IP Next instance to your infrastructure (the second instance is at 10.1.1.9)

      :scale: 25%
#. Follow procedure that was used to onboard initial device with instance 2 (10.1.1.9). Upon completion you should have four total instances as shown in below screenshot.

      :scale: 25%
#. Click the mode link (the word "Standalone" under the "Mode" column) of the standalone BIG-IP Next instance (big-ip-next-01.f5demo.com) you want to become the active node in the BIG-IP Next HA instance.
   .. image:: lab6_img03_enable_ha_on_instance1.png
      :scale: 25%
#. The High Availability panel opens.
#. Click the **Enable HA** button.
#. The HA Nodes panel opens.
   The name and IP address for the BIG-IP Next instance that you selected displays.
   This will be the active node in the BIG-IP Next HA instance after itâ€™s created.
#. From the **Available Standby Instances** list, select the BIG-IP Next instance (big-ip-next-02.f5demo.com) you want to designate as the standby node in the BIG-IP Next HA instance, and click the **Next** button.
   .. image:: lab6_img05_add_ha_select_ha_node.png
      :scale: 25%
#. BIG-IP Next Central Manager displays only BIG-IP Next instances that meet the requirements to be a standby node. That is, only healthy BIG-IP Next instances running the same software version as the future active node on the same provider (VE).
#. From the **Control Plane VLAN** list, you'll need to create a new Control Plane VLAN for this BIG-IP Next HA instance by clicking the **Create VLAN** link.

   Use the name "control-plane-vlan" for this and Tag "3999"
   .. image:: lab6_img07_add_ha_create_controlplane_vlan.png
      :scale: 25%
   Click **Save**
#. From the **Data Plane VLAN** list for this BIG-IP Next HA instance, you'll need to create a new Data Plane VLAN by clicking the **Create VLAN** link.
   .. image:: lab6_img08_add_ha_vlan_data_plane.png
      :scale: 25%
   Use the name "data-plane-vlan" for this and select Untagged Interface: "1.3"

   Click **Save**
#. After you select the VLANs, click the **Next** button.
   .. image:: lab6_img10_add_ha_vlan_configuration_complete.png
      :scale: 25%
#. The HA Properties panel opens.
#. Enter the **HA Name** (example: ha1) for this high availability pair of nodes. This name should be unique for each pair managed by the Next Central Manager instance.
#. Enter the **HA Management (Floating) IP Address** (should be 10.1.1.9) for use when failing over to the standby node.
#. Enter the **Control Plane** and **Data Plane IP** addresses that the active and standby nodes use for communication with each other. (See screenshot for suggested IP addresses)
   Address for big-ip-next-01.f5demo.com: control plane: 10.1.1.77/24; data plane: 10.1.40.7/24 and big-ip-next-02.f5demo.com: control plane: 10.1.1.88/24; data plane: 10.1.40.8/24
#. The CIDR must be unique for each IP address and must use the same interface.

#. Click **Next**.
#. The Traffic VLANs panel opens and displays the VLANs you specified for traffic.
   .. image:: lab6_img12_traffic_vlan_unconfigured.png
      :scale: 25%
#. You can have only one IP address for each active and standby node, but you can add additional floating IP addresses by clicking on the VLAN name.
#. Click each VLAN to open a panel to add the respective Active, Standby, and Floating IP addresses. You may need to reassign the IP address that shows up when you first enter the page from a Floating Self-IP to the Active Self-IP.

   Active Node IP Address: 10.1.10.7/24; Standby Node IP Address: 10.1.10.8/24; Floating IP Address: 10.1.10.9/24
   Click **Save**
   .. image:: lab6_img14_add_ha_traffic_vlans_internal.png
      :scale: 25%
   Active Node IP Address: 10.1.20.7/24; Standby Node IP Address: 10.1.20.8/24; Floating IP Address: 10.1.20.9/24
   Click **Save**
#. When each VLAN displays a green check mark, you can proceed.
   .. image:: lab6_img15_add_ha_traffic_vlans_overview_complete.png

   Click **Next**.
#. The Summary screen opens to display the BIG-IP Next HA configuration you specified.
   .. image:: lab6_img16_add_ha_summary.png
      :scale: 25%
   Click **Deploy to HA**. If Deploy to HA is not available, you may need to revisit the HA VLANs section of the HA Parameters panel (if there is not a green checkmark next to HA VLANs; workaround the missing green checkmark by pulling down each of the VLAN selections and re-selecting the items already selected; after this, you can return to the Summary Page to Deploy to HA).
#. You'll be prompted to confirm the deployment.
   .. image:: lab6_img17_add_ha_deploy_to_ha_confirm.png
      :scale: 25%
   Click **Yes, Deploy**
   It may take several minutes for the HA Deployment process to complete
#. Assuming a successful deployment, you'll see the properties of the HA instance you just created.
   .. image:: lab6_img18_ha_instance_upgrade.png

#. Click **Exit** and you'll be returned to your My Instances list and you'll see that you now have an instance of type HA under the "Mode" column.
